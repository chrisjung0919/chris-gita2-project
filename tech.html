<p class="p1">Initially, "Project Titan" was rumored to involve an electric 
vehicle called we are 
calling "Apple Car," delivered 
by 2019 or 2020. Towards the end of 2015 however, the program 
experienced "an incredible failure of leadership," according to one source, in 
which managers fought over where Titan was going. This led to the 
departure of project leader Steve Zadesky. The original vision of an "Apple Car" that would detect its driver via fingerprint and then drive them anywhere had 
transit	ioned from a partially autonomous car to something more ambitious. However, another factor 
that may have pulled Apple away from its own car is the automotive supply chain. While Apple is used to being able to exert heavy control over suppliers for devices like the iPhone, the company may 
have discovered that auto parts makers would be less eager to commit to an "Apple Car," given the deeper expenses involved, and Apple likely producing vehicles in small initial numbers.
Apple's use of sleek lines in other products could be reused in the "Apple Car," as well as 
wide-swinging doors that eliminate the need for a permanent center door pillar, making openings even larger. Proposals 
include the use of AR and VR technology, in-screen displays, privacy lighting, and unique sunroof designs, among other suggestions.</p>
<p class="p2">Reports in late 2020 indicate Apple may be ahead of schedule and a product may be ready by 2024. It could feature a radical new battery design that would reduce cost and extend 
driving range.Ming-Chi Kuo has stated that a release is unlikely before 2025, that most rumors about a launch prior to that have been "overhyped." Given that there have been no manufacturers 
selected, TF Securities estimates that if "everything goes well" a launch between 2025 and 2027 is likely.
Hyundai has confirmed that Apple has approached it and other companies about producing the Apple Car. Such advanced talks are normal and indicate Apple is ready to begin production in the coming 
months. The same report indicates that despite starting production, the car will not be ready to launch for years yet â€” 2024 at the earliest, though 2027 seems to be more realistic. Apple is expected 
to build a "beta" version of the "Apple Car" by 2022 then order 100,000 for production in 2024.</p>
<p class="p3">Unlike the designs, which are brought up in patent filings and rumors, it is actively known Apple has developed and tested a self-driving system, one that has appeared in public 
filings with government regulators, and has even been spotted on public roads. Then-director of product integrity at Apple Steve Kenner said the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy paved a safe and flexible 
path toward the development of automated vehicles, but suggested proposed regulations could be more open for companies new to the industry.One reason for using existing vehicles for these tests is that 
driving an "Apple Car" that Apple has created would spoil the surprise for its launch. Publicly showing off a new vehicle design would also directly hand ideas to other car manufacturers, potentially 
allowing them to innovate on Apple's car before it is unveiled.</p>
